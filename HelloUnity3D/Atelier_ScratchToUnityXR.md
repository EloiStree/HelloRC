![image](https://github.com/EloiStree/HelloRC/assets/20149493/acb24fa5-8d41-41fa-8f73-77622d9faff7)

**Workshop Duration:**
- Minimum 3 weeks: Remove topic and compress time to practice
- Best 5 weeks: Not time to stop but enough time to practice
- Maximum 8: Allows exploration of side topics asked by participants.

**Requirements, the will to:**
- Code basics or review the basics
- Learn Unity3D for Android OS
- (Optionally) XR & Spatial computing
- (Optionally) Old AI & Neural AI

Personal goals for the workshop:
> Have fun with participants online (or in the classroom), learning how to code and how to mod.
> Teach a range of skills while battling from the first week to the last week of the workshop.
> Teach the power of Git for personal use and online community projects.

Personal goals for the game `Hello RC`:
> Give the possibility to learn from any language or any engine how to code on a fun coder eSport game.

Objectives to reach in this workshop:
> The student is able to code a Unity app in C# with a small AI, playing a car and drone design from a WebSocket. The designs should be exported in an Asset Bundle on GitHub and should be visible in XR Meta Quest 3.
> The student will also learn Unity skills in the Unity3D certification, along with general knowledge about XR and room recognition.

Junior: Learn the basics of the industry while having fun learning code in Unity3D and XR exploration
Medior: Be able to practice a better coding style on a challenging game while learning XR knowledge and practicing AI coding
Advance: Be able to review basics needed to work in the video game and learn how to create XR in a spatial computing environment.

## Structure Proposition

_This structure is just a proposition. It can be changed, adapted, or adjusted based on the needs of the workshop._

_No "advance" Unity here because it will be practiced in the following milestone_

### Android:
- Build a first Android phone application to control the car and drone with Unity3D
- Learn what Android is and its relationship with Unity3D and the Windows platform
- Learn to use ADB and its options to record and configure the phone and their XR headset.
