I try to use MQTT but I find out that it is a bad idea because you can't do an read by user and write by server.
Use unity code with Mirror on client is to much risk for the user.

So the only option left that is not webrtc is:
- UDP for local
- Websocket server in ASP 
- Webpage but with delay.


I learn to use XAMPP for the website.

Create a server in websocket:
