**Workshop Duration:** 
- minimum 3 weeks: Remove topic and compress time to pratice
- best 5 weeks: Not time to stop but enough time to pratice
- maximum 8: Allows exploration to side topic asked by participants.


**Requirement, the will to:**
- Coding basic or review the basic
- Learn Unity3D for Android OS
- (Optinally) XR & Spacial computing
- (Optinally) Old AI & Neural AI 


Personnal goal for the workshop:
> Have fun with participants online (or in classroom), learning how to code and how to mod.  
> Teach a range of skills while battling from the first week to the last week of the workshop.  
> Teach the power of Git for personnal use and online community project.  

Personnal goal for the game `Hello RC`:
> Give the possibility to learn from any language or any engine how to code on a fun coder eSport game.

Objective to reach in this workshop:
> The student is able to code a Unity app in C# with a small AI, playing a car and drone design from a WebSocket. The designs should be exported in an Asset Bundle on GitHub and should be visible in XR Meta Quest 3.
> The student will also learn Unity skills in the Unity3D certification, along with general knowledge about XR and room recognition.

Junior: Learn the basic of the industrie while having fun learning code in a Unity3D and XR exploration
Medior: Be able to practice a better coding style on a challenging game while learning XR knowledge and praticing AI coding
Advance: Be able to review basic needed to work in the video game and learn how to create XR in spacial computing environment.



## Structure proposition
_This structure is just a proposition. It can be change, adapted or adjusted based on the need of the workshop to give_
